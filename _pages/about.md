Hi, I'm Olabode (O-lah-boh-dey) Anise (Uh-nee-shey), and I am Data Science Leader at Figma. I lead three Data Science teams that help drive the strategy of our AI and Infra organizations as well an applied research and data platform team. 

Before Figma, I was a Software Engineer at Google on the Chrome Safe Browsing team where my work centered around preventing users from downloading malware. And before Google, I was a Data Scientist at [Duo Security](https://duo.com/). At Duo, my foucs I rearchitected our data ingestion system to make data more accessible, helped build the company's first ML pipeline, and conducted analyses to understand security behaviors of our users. 

Above all, I enjoy work that centers around understanding humans and their mental models around technology. This has led me to my interests in Usable Security and Human-Centered Machine Learning.

When I'm not at work, I spend most of my time reading, playing basketball or kickball, and watching the Steelers, Auburn Tigers and Phoenix Suns.
