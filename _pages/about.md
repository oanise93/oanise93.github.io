Hi, I'm Olabode (O-lah-boh-dey) Anise (Uh-nee-shey), and I am a Software Engineer at Google on the Chrome Safe Browsing team. At Google, my work has centered around preventing users from downloading malware. Before Google, I was a Data Scientist at [Duo Security](https://duo.com/) where I focused on making data accessible to different parts of the business and helping others understand how people were using the product. Above all, I enjoy work that centers around understanding humans and their mental models. This has led me to my interests in Usable Security and Human-Centered Machine Learning.

When I'm not at work, I spend most of my time reading, playing basketball or kickball, and watch ingthe Steelers, Auburn Tigers and Phoenix Suns.
